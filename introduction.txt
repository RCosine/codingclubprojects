Hello everyone,

Our first project is on "Binary Search."
Binary search is a fast and efficient algorithm that can find an element in a sorted list by repeatedly 
dividing the list into two halves and comparing the middle element with the target value. It has many applications 
in computer science, such as searching databases, encryption, and compression. In this project, we will implement binary 
search in Python and test its performance on different datasets.
